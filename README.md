# HandWrittenDigitsRecognition
This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence chain. As the name suggests, this ANN recognizes digits that have been written by hand. There are two options to test. It is possible to upload images with digits (they must be 28px*28px) or write the digit at the moment, in an appropriate place for that purpose.
