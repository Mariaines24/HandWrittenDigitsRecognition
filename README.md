# Hand Written Digits Recognition
This project was developed for the Artificial Intelligence course. As the name suggests, this **ANN recognizes digits that have been written by hand**. There are two options to test. It is possible to upload images with digits (they must be 28px*28px) or write the digit at the moment, in an appropriate place for that purpose.
You can lear more about the ANN in the **Report.ipynb file**.
